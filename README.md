# sudokuSolver
This is sudoku field Solver (currently) using backtesting.
Currently the performance is not that great and will hopefully be updated in the feauture.

Planned updates:
- sudokuSolver v1.1 -> should get faster, but still be using backtesting
- sudokuSolver v2 -> using a different approach, hopefully this will fasten things up

- add gui to all versions
