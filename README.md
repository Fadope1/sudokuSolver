# sudokuSolver
This is sudoku field Solver (currently) using backtracking.
Currently the performance is not that great and will hopefully be updated in the feauture.

Planned updates:
- sudokuSolver v1.1 -> should get faster by using more numpy..., but still be using backtesting
- sudokuSolver v2 -> using a different approach = sudoku tricks to fill the filled with logic. Only the last way should be guessing using backtracking.

- add gui to all versions
